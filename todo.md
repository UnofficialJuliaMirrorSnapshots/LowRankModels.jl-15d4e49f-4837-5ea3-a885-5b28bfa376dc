# To Do

* Set up a single command for multiple imputation:
	a) pick m random subsets of data,
	b) choose model of rank k, regularization constant Î± for each subset,
	c) impute missing data from each of the m selected models.
	* (nandana will do this)

* Documentation!
	* how to think about mpca
	* imputation
	* error metrics for cross validation
	* new syntax for fitting data frame
		* how to specify loss function(s)
	* parallel fitting
	* full rank model / prisma

* Poisson loss
	* scaling?
	* to log or not to log? that is the interpretative issue
